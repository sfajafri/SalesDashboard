Data of a super store sales have been provided all across the states of USA for two years i.e. 2019 & 2020. 
The main purpose is to analyze the business position in terms of sales & profit and on the basis of it provide realistic sales forecasting for upcoming 15 days.
In this project I imported, cleaned and process the data, designed dashboard, used advance charts and maps, filters and slicers & forecasted the data.

Observations:
-	The sales have witnesses significant improvement in 2020 as compared to last year, with monthly sales pattern showing steady improvement.
-	The profitability, however, witnesses decline in 2020 as compared to 2019 with fluctuation in profitability particularly in the last months of 2019 and initial months of 2020.
-	California state has the largest share in sales followed by New York & Texas while the states of Maine & District of Colombia have the lowest share in revenues.
-	Office supplies category & consumer segments are leading in sales as compared to other categories and segments respectively.
-	Cash on Delivery (COD) is the most popular payment mode while Standard Class comprehensively leads in the shipment mode.

Recommendations:
-	Company must probe the reason for decline in profit despite increase in sales as well as the reason for fluctuation in profit.
-	Company may focus on low performing states and take measures to improve their share translating in to increasing revenues.
-	The company to take steps to increase payment through online or cards and to reduce the volume of cash on delivery.
